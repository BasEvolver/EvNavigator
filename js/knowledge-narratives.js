    'techflow-solutions': {
        'D1': { disciplineName: "Organizational Excellence", narrative: "The management team is technically strong with deep product knowledge. However, there is a significant gap in experience related to scaling a go-to-market (GTM) organization in a private equity-backed environment. The sales compensation plan is misaligned with a SaaS model, as it only rewards new logos and not renewals or expansion." },
        'D2': { disciplineName: "Sales", narrative: "The sales engine is inefficient. Analysis of the funnel shows an 80% leakage rate from MQL to SQL, and the final win rate of 15% is below industry benchmarks. This suggests a misalignment between marketing and sales. There is also a critical customer concentration risk, with the top 2 customers accounting for 28% of ARR." },
        'D3': { disciplineName: "Marketing", narrative: "Marketing efforts are generating leads, but the high MQL-to-SQL drop-off indicates a potential issue with lead quality or nurturing. The brand has a low Lighthouse performance score and lacks a formal process for prioritizing customer feature requests, impacting market perception." },
        'D4': { disciplineName: "Partner Ecosystem", narrative: "The company has no formal channel partnership program. This is a significant untapped growth vector. Existing distributor agreements are basic and do not represent a scalable channel." },
        'D5': { disciplineName: "Product & Engineering", narrative: "The core product suffers from significant technical debt due to its legacy monolithic architecture. This directly impacts developer velocity, with a 95-day cycle time (well below the 45-60 day benchmark). This is further evidenced by the failure of the last three product launches, which generated zero revenue despite a $3.2M investment." },
        'D6': { disciplineName: "Customer Experience", narrative: "The customer base is loyal, but this loyalty is at risk. NRR is positive but low for a SaaS company at 105%. Churn analysis is difficult due to poor data quality, but NPS surveys show a mix of promoters and detractors. The lack of a dedicated Customer Success function is a major gap." },
        'D7': { disciplineName: "Digital Core", narrative: "The company's digital core is brittle. The architecture is a monolith, there is no CI/CD pipeline, and the release process is entirely manual and high-risk. Security is also a concern, with high-severity vulnerabilities identified in a recent penetration test." },
        'D8': { disciplineName: "Finance", narrative: "The company's reported financials are misleading. The 'Quality of Earnings' is poor due to non-standard ARR composition, where only 59% of reported ARR is true recurring revenue. The finance team's processes are highly manual, such as expense reporting, which creates inefficiency." },
        'D9': { disciplineName: "General & Administrative (G&A)", narrative: "G&A functions have several compliance and legal risks. Several enterprise contracts are missing signatures, and there is one active patent litigation case that poses a contingent liability risk. The BCP/DR plan is over three years old and has not been tested." }
    },
    'cloudvantage': {
        'D1': { disciplineName: "Organizational Excellence", narrative: "The key organizational challenge is managing the cultural and operational integration of the recent NewCo acquisition. There is a critical leadership gap in the EMEA region, with the VP of Sales position vacant for three months, which is directly impacting regional performance." },
        'D2': { disciplineName: "Sales", narrative: "Sales performance is strong overall (103% of quota) with excellent NRR (128%), primarily driven by successful cross-selling into the NewCo customer base. However, this masks a critical issue in the EMEA region, which is at only 75% of its target due to the leadership gap and a 9% drop in logo retention." },
        'D3': { disciplineName: "Marketing", narrative: "Marketing is effectively supporting the GTM strategy, with MQLs 15% above target. The primary challenge is increasing competitive pressure from a competitor named 'AgileCloud', whose aggressive discounting is eroding our win rate in the mid-market segment (down to 35%)." },
        'D4': { disciplineName: "Partner Ecosystem", narrative: "The partner ecosystem is an underdeveloped but high-potential area. There is a strong technology alliance with AWS, but the reseller and GSI channels are nascent. The immediate opportunity is to formalize the reseller program to accelerate expansion into the APAC market." },
        'D5': { disciplineName: "Product & Engineering", narrative: "The engineering team maintains excellent platform stability (99.98% uptime). The primary strategic challenge is the 'AI-Powered Feature Launch,' which is currently 'At Risk'. The delay is caused by technical complexities in integrating NewCo's legacy data models." },
        'D6': { disciplineName: "Customer Experience", narrative: "The customer experience is strong, reflected in a high NPS of 52 and 98% customer retention. However, the integration of NewCo customers has led to a temporary 15% increase in support ticket volume. The team's focus is on improving the onboarding experience for former NewCo clients." },
        'D7': { disciplineName: "Digital Core", narrative: "The Digital Core is stable and scalable, with cloud infrastructure costs running 5% under budget due to recent FinOps initiatives. The primary focus is now on data strategy, specifically the integration of NewCo's data to power the upcoming AI features." },
        'D8': { disciplineName: "Finance", narrative: "The company's financial health is strong, with a 'Rule of 40' score of 58%. However, pricing analysis reveals a low win rate (25%) for the 'Professional' tier in the mid-market, suggesting a price/value mismatch that needs to be addressed." },
        'D9': { disciplineName: "General & Administrative (G&A)", narrative: "G&A functions are operating efficiently. The legal team is focused on standardizing NewCo customer contracts, and HR is actively recruiting for the EMEA VP of Sales role. There are no major G&A-related risks at this time." }
